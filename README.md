# FiveM-ServerManager
### Not giving support right now, this is super early alpha. Mostly just here to easily add to my server for testing. I mean come on, I don't even have StyleCI, TravisCI or even tests written at this point. BASICALLY all I'm saying is use at your own risk. Though honestly, even at this stage it does more that any of the others out there for FiveM at the moment.
